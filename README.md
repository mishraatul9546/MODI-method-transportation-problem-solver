# MODI-method-transportation-problem-solver
Solves the transportation problem using MODI method (works for degenerate situations as well). Calculates IBFS using NWCR, then applies MODI method to get the optimal solution. Degeneracy is removed by allocating a very small (0.000001) value at an independent position
